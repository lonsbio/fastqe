# FASTQ with Emoji = FASTQE ðŸ¤”

Read one or more FASTQ files, [fastqe](https://fastqe.com/) will compute quality stats for each file and print those stats as emoji... for some reason.

Given a fastq file in Illumina 1.8+/Sanger format, calculate the mean (rounded) score for each position and print a corresponding emoji!

This repository is now it's own organisation: https://github.com/fastqe/fastqe/
